# Sabina Grisi - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Sabina! I am currently on my way to completing my degree in Digitale Medien (B.Sc.) at Hochschule Fulda. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/sabinagrisi/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Lebenslauf_SabinaGrisi.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.

## Portfolio Projects:
### Tech Store Sales
#### **Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sabinagrisi/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Tech%20Store%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

***What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?***

*The best month for sales was December where they made a total of $4,613,443.34*

*The city that sold the most products was San Francisco (CA).*

***What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?***

*The best time for ads to be aired would be 11AM-12PM or around 7PM.*

***What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?***

*The product sold the most were AAA Batteries. This may be due to a lot of electronics using them as a power source and its cost in comparison to the other items.*
